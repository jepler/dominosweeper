# Dominosweeper

Many years ago--the fact that the original announcement has a note that Python 1.5.2 is required should give you some idea--I wrote this minesweeper variant
in which the board has a combination of square and domino-shaped cells. It also
has a much more powerful middle-click than traditional minesweeper.

In 2008, I updated it to the then-current Python 2.x. I noted in my
(blog post)[https://emergent.unpythonic.net/01226670165] that it didn't require
any changes.

This time around, there were some changes needed for python3, but as the
program is small it didn't take long.

I figured I'd give it a little bit of a revival on github.
